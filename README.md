Docker-StarLogs
===============


## Getting Started
#### Download & Container Startup
This will run/start a `docker` container `daemonized` with the ports `8080` opened from host to guest.
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 argonqq/starlogs
```

#### Have fun :smile:
Open Chrome or Firefox (not Safari!) and paste the IP address of your docker machine with the associated port (8080).
```bash
http://<IP.ADDR>:8080/starlogs.html
```

#### :heart: I would love to see some commits :heart:
